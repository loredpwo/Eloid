# For C/C++ parsing using Clang
libclang

# Optional but recommended (if using clang.cindex on some systems)
clang

# For type annotations and dataclasses (Python 3.7+ includes dataclasses by default)
typing_extensions  # For older Python versions if needed

# If using Python < 3.9, you might also need:
# astunparse (for ast.unparse if you're not using Python 3.9+)
# astunparse

# These two are placeholders for your custom/hypothetical parsers:
# Youâ€™ll need to create or install bindings for Go and Rust parsing.
# These are NOT installable via pip, but here's how you can label them:
go_parser @ file:///path/to/go_parser  # hypothetical parser
syn @ file:///path/to/syn              # hypothetical parser
